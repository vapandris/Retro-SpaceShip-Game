 # Simple retro game written in ZIG using raylib

 The point was to try out ZIG and raylib.\
 Implemented simple logic to represent the game-state, created structures to draw and update the different objects in the game.\
 Implemented simple collision detection, and repeat timer, so we can spawn new enemy ships periodicly and the ships can shoot bullets randomly.
